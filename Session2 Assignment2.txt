Question)Differentiate Between Compiler and Interpreter.

Compiler
It compiles the source code into bytecode.The code which we write is known as source code and when we run our compiler it just convert that code into bytecode.
Interpreter
Now the work of compiler is done and the use of Interpreter comes in context, it actually convert that bytecode into Machine language.
